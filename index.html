			<h2>Topic</h2>
			<p>Draw Your Loneliness sets out to help its visitors to find peace and happiness in times of aloneness and loneliness. Using art as a medium, our deepest and most difficult thoughts and feelings, such as aloneness and loneliness, can be expressed and reflected upon. By creating art that allows visitors to reflect and open up the conversation on those feelings, they become visible, examinable, and less ominous. This is one way, out of the many different ways, to make peace with aloneness and loneliness.
			</p>

			<h2>Motivation</h2>
			<p>This project was conceptualized due to my own overwhelming feelings of isolation while studying during the pandemic. In Fall 2020, I was able to express my experiences visually through smaller projects, which allowed me to better understand my relationship with aloneness and helped me realized that I had made peace loneliness. In doing so, I realized that visual expression and communication with my peers is a strong method of finding peace and happiness in these times.
			</p>

			<h2>Why Care?</h2>
			<p>Loneliness causes people to feel empty and unwanted, making them crave human contact — but this state of mind makes it difficult to connect with others. It is a growing problem, and its effects are even more widespread thanks to the isolation brought on by the pandemic. These wide range of negative effects on the mind and body include depression, increased stress levels, decreased memory and learning, and more (Cherry).</p>
			<p>Since this is a very difficult and personal topic to approach, Draw Your Loneliness attempts to help its visitors reflect and overcome these feelings by visualizing it and facing it head-on. Overcoming loneliness begins with making a conscious effort on people’s part to make a change.

			Artists like Edward Hopper is known for producing artwork that embodies modern loneliness. Through his work, Hopper shows us that one way to make peace with loneliness is to “create work that explores and examines it” (“The Art of Being Alone”). By creating artwork that tackles these feelings, we not only produce a visual expression of a seemingly big and ominous void, but also offer a way to connect with others who might have the same experiences.
